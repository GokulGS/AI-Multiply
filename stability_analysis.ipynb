    "# Stability analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## what we have:\n",
    "the purpose of this notebook is to analyse individual patients' timelines with respect to their \"attraction\" to one or more of the clusters generated by LDA (see notebook NB1: LDA_topics_generator...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "to achieve this, it assumes that \"per-stage association vectors\" for each patient have been previously generated -- this happens in NB1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of sequence of stages, for a patient with timeline: `['OA', 'skin_ulcer', 'dermatitis']`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[ [PMR], [PMR, glaucoma]], 1000059: [['OA'], ['OA', 'skin_ulcer'], ['OA', 'skin_ulcer', 'dermatitis']]`\n",
    "\n",
    "the code below:\n",
    "- calculates the **trajectory** for each patient. This is defined as the sequence of <R,theta> values (see below for an informal definition), one for each stage in the patient's timeline.\n",
    "- based on the shape of the trajectory, it labels each patient as \"stable\", \"unstable\", but also allows a patient to be \"stable after a certain point in time\" (*eventually stable*) or \"stable until a certain point in time\". A stable or eventually stable patient will have a cluster asosciated with them, which is the last cluster pointed to by theta in the sequence, and is called the *dominant* cluster.\n",
    "- generates a new dataframe where each patient and their trajectories are associated with a stability label, and the dominant cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What needs to be done next:\n",
    "Starting from the new dataframe, we want to analyse the collection of patients and their trajectories to try and determine what characterises stable/unstable patients.\n",
    "Ultimately, we want to determine (1) which patients can be reliably predicted to eventually fall into its dominant cluster, and (2) how soon the prediction can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some of the questions and tasks:\n",
    " - calculate the prevalence of each condition in (1) the general population, (2) the stable population, (3) the unstable population. How are they different? if visible differences exist, can these be quantified?\n",
    " - are some combinations or *sequences* of two or more conditions more likely to occur in one population than in another? (hopefully, it will be the case that \n",
    " - for those patients that are \"stable after X\", how soon does X occur? in other words, how soon can we start predicting that someone falls into a specific cluster? to answer this, we may try several strategies. For example, we can look at the top-ranking diseases in each cluster (say, the top-10). We then look at timelines to see how early in the timeline these occur. For example, suppose disease D is top in cluster C, and D is the first event to occur for patient P. Intuitively, this can be taken as a strong signal that C will eventually be the dominant cluster for P, although this is not certain. In general, the sooner these top diseases are diagnoses occur in a patient, the more confident I can be in predicting their corresponding cluster will be the dominant cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a strategy for making predictions regarding the dominant cluster, we need a way to validate them, in other words we need to quantify the *performance of the prediction*. This is actually trivial as we know the dominant cluster, so we can use that as ground truth to simply calculate the ture and false positives and negatives for each prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a \"parametric\" performance metric, where parameter S indicates the stage at which we \"take the guess\". Obviously we expect performance to be low when S=1, unless the patient has exactly one of the top diseases right at the start, and to increase as we move towards the end of the timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## changing the cluster structure\n",
    "the setup just described should provide an interesting framework to experient with various predictive strategies based on partial information about patient timelines. but complete information about the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, suppose we have more than one option to cluster the diseases in the first place. for instance, LDA allows (indeed it requires) to specify the number of clusters. Thus, the cluster themselves provide one more dimension for the analysis: everything that has been done above can be repeated for a different set of clusters, and this leads to a comparison acorss different clustering schemes. We could eventually use this analysis to suggest the optimal clustering scheme, which is the one that leads to the \"best possible predictions\" (in some sense to be defined precisely).\n",
    "\n",
    "## defining trajectories: R and theta\n",
    "the informal definition is simple as it is inspired by the physics of gravity. Assume you have 4 clusters, and imagine placing them on a circle, 90 degrees apart (so they are are 0, 90, 180, 270 deg). You are at the centre of the circle. You are \"pulled\" towards each cluster with a force that is represented by a weight found in a patient-association vector (calculated below). So given such a vector, you can compute the resultant of the forces. This is a vector with a strength (R) and a direction (theta, defined relative to the 0 degrees axis). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalise this to any number of clusters, for example 5 clusters will be placed at angles 0, 360/5, 360/5\\*2, etc. and the same calculations will hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "now, a patient is characterised by a sequence of such vectors, one per stage (see above). This means that we can calculate a sequence of <R,theta> values. Stability is defined by looking at changes in R, and the *dominant cluster* is the one in the direction theta (in some cases, theta actually points to an angle in between two clusters. This provides an uncertain dominant cluster)."
